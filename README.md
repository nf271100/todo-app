# To-Do List Application

This project is a fully functional **To-Do List** web application built using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **MongoDB**. It allows users to manage tasks efficiently by adding, editing, deleting, and filtering tasks. Data is persisted using MongoDB, ensuring tasks are saved across sessions.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Easily add new tasks to your list.
- **Mark Complete/Incomplete**: Toggle tasks between completed and incomplete status.
- **Edit Tasks**: Modify existing tasks within the application.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks you no longer need.
- **Filter Tasks**: View tasks based on their status (all, completed, or incomplete).
- **Validation**: Prevents empty or duplicate tasks from being added.
- **Persistent Data**: Task data is saved in MongoDB and persists across sessions.
- **Unit Testing**: Includes unit tests using Jest and React Testing Library for core functionality.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React framework for building the app with server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and enhances development experience.
- **MongoDB**: Database used to store tasks persistently.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling the user interface.
- **React Icons**: Adds icons to the application (edit, delete, complete).
- **Jest & React Testing Library**: For unit testing and verifying core functionality.
